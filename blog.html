	      				I remember in the early days of the internet, around 2005, before it got popular (or arguably, out of hand), there was a website where graffiti enthusiasts from around the world gathered.  They posted and discussed photos of handscrawls, murals, and 'tags', a graffiti artist's signature.</p><p> They would go out into the world for the sake of the site, so it seemed. The community had their back & were as wind to their sails. Members explored and photographed abandoned buildings & anywhere the art proliferated. The forum had a life of its own.</p>

	     				<p>There was an emphasis on handwriting - throwies, drip-ink  signatures: manifestos with coded meaning.  Sometimes, I suspected that people would post their own work- and I suspect that others might have had that same suspicion- an interesting dynamic would develop on those threads. Of course, the po were able to track ip addresses. I remember one kid who had a signature stating your ip address and approximate location...</p>

       				I can see it now... a graph-head spending half his time drawing, occasionally visiting the Board, while getting familiar with the command line. He looks over at the box, wonders what's happening... soon he's spending half his time exploring the file system, getting to know the basic GNU utilities....  so it begins...
